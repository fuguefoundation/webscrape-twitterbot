This project aims to use web scraping (`Javascript`) to generate properly formed data that can then be auto-tweeted using `Python` or adding into an [API](https://github.com/fuguefoundation/ff-api). Content of pages to scrape and the tweets themselves will follow the charitable principles of [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/).

### 80,000 Hours

[Problem Profiles](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/) - If you want to maximise your chance of having a big positive impact with your career, we think it’s usually best to work on a global problem that’s large in scale, solvable, and neglected. These are not always the biggest problems in the world — rather they are the issues that receive little attention compared to how important they are and how much can be done about them.

### Giving What We Can

[Causes](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/causes/) - One of the biggest factors determining whether a charity will be effective or not is the problem that it's trying to solve. We investigate promising cause areas to find the best opportunities to do good.
